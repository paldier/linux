Voltage/Current Regulator Virtual Consumer

Virtual consumer driver is mainly supposed to be used for debug and test
purposes. It gives a posibility to control a regulator voltage/current from
userspace.

The bindings below helps to define a dummy platform device in device tree and
bind the virtual consumer with a regulator you want to test.

Properties:
  - compatible: must be "intel,reg-virt-platdev"
  - regulator: a phandle to existing regulator node.


Example:

reg-virt-consumer: {
	compatible = "intel,reg-virt-platdev";
	regulator = <$buck1_reg>;
};

reg-virt-consumer2: {
	compatible = "intel,reg-virt-platdev";
	regulator = <$buck2_reg>;
};

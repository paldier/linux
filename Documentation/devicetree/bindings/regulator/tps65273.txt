Texas Instruments TPS65273 power regulator

The TPS65273V is a monolithic dual synchronous buck regulator with wide 4.5V
to 18-V operating input voltage. It has external feedback resistors that can
be used for setting the initial start up voltage. The output voltage in each
buck can be programmable from 0.68 V to 1.95 V in 10-mV steps with I2C
Controlled 7-Bits VID.

Two bucks in TPS65273V can be paralleled to deliver up to 10-A load current by
floating the MODE pin.


Required properties:

- compatible: "ti,tps65273"
- reg: I2C slave address
- regulators: A node that houses a sub-node for each regulator within the
  device. The tps65273V is a dual-synchronous DC-DC so it will create
  two regulator devices on the system. Each sub-node is identified using
  the node's name, with valid values listed below. The content of each
  sub-node is defined by the standard binding for regulators found at
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

  The valid names for regulators are: dcdc1, dcdc2


Optional properties:

- vout_slew_rate: programmable slew rate control for output voltage.
- vout_psm_mode: Pulse Skipping Mode to achieve high efficiency in light load.


Example:

tps:tps65273@62 {
	compatible = "ti,tps65273";
	reg = <0x62>;

	regulators {
		buck1_reg: BUCK1 {
			regulator-name = "1V15VDD";
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-boot-on;
			regulator-min-microvolt = <900000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1200000>;
			regulator-microvolt-offset = <0>;
			vout-slew-rate = <0>;
			vout-psm-mode  = <0>;
		};

		buck2_reg: BUCK2 {
			regulator-name = "2V15VDD";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <900000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1200000>;
			regulator-microvolt-offset = <0>;
			vout-slew-rate = <0>;
			vout-psm-mode  = <0>;
		};
	};
};

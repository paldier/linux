Intel WAN XPCS PHY controller

This file documents the dt bindings for the WAN XPCS PHY

Required properties:
- compatible	: should be "intel,wanxpcsphy-prx300"
- clocks	: frequency clock.
		  Optionally we can include gate clock
- clock-names	: should be "freq".
		  Optionally we can include "xpcs" and "hwclken" for gate clock
- clock-frequency	: frequency of pll3. This is necessary so that clk
			  framework can select the correct parent
- #phy-cells	: should be <0>
- intel,wanxpcsphy-syscon	: phandle to sysconf chiptop
- resets	: list of phandle and reset specifier pairs.
- reset-names	: list of reset signal names. Should be "phy".
		  See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt

Note that WAN XPCS and PON are exclusive; one must be disabled to use the other
one.

Example:

wan_xpcs_phy: phy {
	compatible = "intel,wanxpcsphy-prx300";
	clocks = <&ponclk>, <&clkgate1 GATE_AON_CLK>, <&clkgate3 GATE_SW_REF>;
	clock-names = "freq", "xpcs", "hwclken";
	clock-frequency = <156250000>;
	#phy-cells = <0>;
	status = "okay";
	resets = <&rcu0 10>;
	reset-names = "phy";
	intel,wanxpcsphy-syscon = <&sysconf>; /* chiptop */
};

Example to use this phy in driver:

test_driver@0 {
	...
	phys = <&wan_xpcs_phy>;
	phy-names = "wan_xpcs"
}
